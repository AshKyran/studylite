    "question": "12. In an experiment, the number of red blood cells present in three samples of blood labelled F, G and H was estimated. Different concentrations of salt solution were separately added to the samples. After an hour, the number of red blood cells present in each sample was counted and recorded as shown below:\n\nSample F — Salt solution % concentration added: 1.0 — Number of red blood cells: Number remained the same\nSample G — Salt solution % concentration added: 0.6 — Number of red blood cells: Fewer cells observed\nSample H — Salt solution % concentration added: 0.4 — Number of red blood cells: No cells observed\n\n(a) Name the physiological process being investigated in the experiment.\n(b) Account for the results made in blood sample F.\n(c) Account for the difference in appearance of red blood cells in samples F and G at the end of the experiment.\n(d) With a reason, predict the possible observation that would be made if blood sample F was treated with a salt concentration of 2.6%.\n(e) State the importance of the process being investigated above during urine formation.",
    "solution": "(a) Osmosis across the red blood cell membrane (osmosis/tonicity effects leading to haemolysis or crenation).\n(b) In sample F (1.0%) the solution is approximately isotonic to the cytoplasm of the red blood cells so there is no net movement of water; cells remain intact and their number remains the same.\n(c) In sample G (0.6%) the solution is hypotonic relative to red blood cells so water enters the cells by osmosis; many cells swell and burst (haemolyse) so fewer intact cells are observed compared with F where cells remain unchanged.\n(d) If sample F were treated with 2.6% salt (a strongly hypertonic solution) red blood cells would lose water and shrink (crenate). Observation: cells appear shrunken/crenated (they do not swell); their shape changes though they remain present as shrunken cells.\n(e) Importance during urine formation: osmosis is essential for reabsorption of water from kidney tubules (particularly in the proximal tubule and collecting duct) and for concentrating urine in the loop of Henle; it helps regulate body water balance and produce urine of appropriate concentration.",
    "working_steps": [
      "Recognise changes in cell counts relate to net water movement due to solute concentration differences.",

    "question": "14. (a) What is the most appropriate method of estimating the population of black ants in a school playing field?\n(b) Why are shorter food chains advantageous in an ecosystem?",
    "solution": "(a) Capture-mark-recapture (mark, release, then recapture and use the ratio to estimate total population) or systematic quadrat sampling and extrapolation; capture-mark-recapture is commonly used for mobile insect populations because it accounts for movement and gives a population estimate.\n(b) Shorter food chains are advantageous because they conserve more energy (less energy lost at each trophic transfer), support greater biomass at higher trophic levels, and reduce the chance of energy depletion and buildup of toxins — making ecosystems more efficient and often more stable for top consumers.",

    "question": "15. (a) Using an example, define convergent evolution.\n(b) Explain how natural selection is advantageous to living organisms.",
    "solution": "(a) Convergent evolution is the process where unrelated organisms independently evolve similar structures or functions because they live in similar environments or face similar selective pressures. Example: the streamlined body shape of sharks (fish) and dolphins (mammal) — analogous features that evolved independently.\n(b) Natural selection is advantageous because it increases the frequency of beneficial traits that improve survival and reproductive success in a given environment. Over generations organisms become better adapted to their environment, increasing their chances of surviving, reproducing and passing on advantageous genes to offspring.",

    "solution": "(a)(i) The aorta.\n(ii) The tricuspid valve (between right atrium and right ventricle) prevents backflow of blood from the right ventricle into the right atrium during ventricular contraction (systole), ensuring one-way flow.\n(b) People with blood group O are called universal donors because their red blood cells lack A and B antigens on the cell surface, so their donated RBCs are less likely to be attacked by anti-A or anti-B antibodies in recipients of other blood groups. (Note: for whole blood transfusion plasma antibodies matter; in practice O negative RBCs are the safest emergency donors.)"

    "question": "17. The following word equation represents a metabolic reaction taking place in an animal tissue.\nGlucose → Lactic acid + Energy\n(a) State the condition under which the reaction occurs.\n(b) How does the size of an animal affect the rate of respiration?",
    "solution": "(a) The reaction occurs under anaerobic conditions (when oxygen supply is insufficient) — anaerobic respiration/fermentation.\n(b) Small animals usually have a larger surface-area-to-volume ratio than large animals; this means they lose heat more quickly and therefore have higher metabolic and respiratory rates per unit mass to maintain body temperature. Conversely, larger animals have a smaller surface-area-to-volume ratio and generally lower metabolic rate per unit mass."

    "title": ":",
    "question": "18. (a) How can sexual reproduction in organisms lead to the evolution of new species?\n(b) State the role of continuous variation in evolution.",
    "solution": "(a) Sexual reproduction produces genetic variation in offspring through recombination of parental genes (independent assortment and crossing over) and by introducing new gene combinations. This variation provides raw material for natural selection; over long periods, isolated populations with different selected traits may diverge reproductively and form new species (speciation).\n(b) Continuous variation provides a range of phenotypes on which natural selection can act; gradual shifts in the distribution of these traits in response to environmental pressures enable populations to adapt continuously and can lead to evolutionary change over time.",

    "solution": "(a) Effects of hypothyroidism in adults include: reduced metabolic rate leading to fatigue and lethargy; weight gain; cold intolerance; slow heart rate (bradycardia); dry, coarse skin; constipation; mental sluggishness or depression; and sometimes enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre) if due to iodine deficiency.\n(b) Hearing process: Sound waves are collected by the pinna (external ear) and travel down the ear canal to vibrate the tympanic membrane (eardrum). Vibrations are transmitted by the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) which amplify the sound and pass vibrations to the oval window of the cochlea. Movements of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph/endolymph) of the cochlea, causing the basilar membrane to move. Hair cells on the organ of Corti bend and convert mechanical vibration into nerve impulses, which travel along the auditory (cochlear) nerve to the brain where they are interpreted as sound."

    "question": "20. (a) Describe how urea is formed in humans.\n(b) Describe the path followed by urea from the site of formation until it is eliminated from the body.",
    "solution": "(a) Urea formation occurs mainly in the liver. Amino acids from protein digestion undergo deamination (removal of the amino group) producing ammonia (NH₃), which is toxic. In the liver, ammonia is converted to urea via the ornithine (urea) cycle: ammonia reacts with carbon (IV) oxide (CO₂) and other intermediates to form urea (a less toxic, soluble compound).\n(b) Path of urea: urea formed in the liver enters the blood plasma → transported in the blood to the kidneys → filtered out of the blood at the glomerulus into the Bowman’s capsule → passes through the renal tubules (some water may be reabsorbed) → collects in the renal pelvis → transported by the ureter to the urinary bladder where urine is stored → expelled from the body through the urethra during urination.",

      "Explain deamination and conversion of ammonia to urea (simple description of urea cycle).",
      "Trace urea movement: liver → blood → kidney filtration → ureter → bladder → urethra."
