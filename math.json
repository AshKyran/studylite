"question": "A Kenyan bank bought and sold foreign currencies on two different days as shown: 12/1/2021: 1 South African Rand — Buying (Ksh) 7.08, Selling (Ksh) 7.10. 12/2/2021: 100 Tanzanian Shillings — Buying (Ksh) 21.12, Selling (Ksh) 21.25. A South African tourist arrived in Kenya on 12/1/2021 with 15,000 South African rands. He changed the whole amount to Kenyan shillings. While in Kenya he spent Ksh. 53,075 and changed the balance to Tanzanian shillings before leaving on 12/2/2021. Determine, in Tanzanian shillings, the amount he received.",
"solution": "250,000 Tanzanian shillings.",

"question": "On a market day, Abdul has 32 goats while Chebet has 56 goats. Chebet sold twice as many goats as Abdul. After the sale, the number of goats that Abdul and Chebet remained with was in the ratio 3 : 5 respectively. Determine the total number of goats sold by Abdul and Chebet in the market.",

Determine the ratio of the earnings of Abdul to Chebet from the sale of goats. Abdul decreased the selling price per goat in the ratio 19 : 21 for the goats that remained. Determine the new selling price per goat.",
"solution": "Ratio of earnings Abdul : Chebet = 21 : 40. New selling price per remaining Abdul's goat = Ksh 3,800.",
"working_steps": [
"From previous problem Abdul sold 8 goats and Chebet sold 16 goats.",

"To find actual prices: total = 8.4p + 16p = 24.4p = 97,600 ⇒ p = 97,600 / 24.4 = 4,000 Ksh (Chebet).",
"Abdul's old price = 1.05 × 4,000 = 4,200 Ksh.",
"Abdul decreased price in ratio 19 : 21 ⇒ new price = (19/21) × 4,200 = 4,200 ÷ 21 × 19 = 200 × 19 = 3,800 Ksh."

"Expand and simplify: −300x + 17,400 = 50x^2 − 200 ⇒ 50x^2 + 300x − 17,600 = 0 ⇒ divide by 50 ⇒ x^2 + 6x − 352 = 0.",
"Solve: discriminant = 6^2 + 4 × 352 = 36 + 1408 = 1444 ⇒ √Δ = 38. So x = (−6 ± 38)/2. Positive root x = 16 (price in March).",
"Number sold in February = 4200/(16 − 2) = 4200/14 = 300 pens. Number in April = 4500/(16 + 2) = 4500/18 = 250 pens.",
